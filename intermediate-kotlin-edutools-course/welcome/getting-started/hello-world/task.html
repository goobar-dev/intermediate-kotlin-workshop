<h2>Welcome to this Intermediate Kotlin Workshop</h2>

<p>In this first section, you'll learn how to use the EduTools plugin to work through examples and exercises in support
    of your workshop.</p>

<h3>Tracking Progress</h3>

<p>The EduTools plugin will track your progress as you work through the examples.
    Each example should have a "call to action" button that says something like <b>Run</b> or <b>Check</b>.
</p>

<p>Clicking this button will validate your code, and will update your progress once you've completed the task.</p>

<p>Some tasks, like this one, may have no code to write. In these cases, simply click <b>Run</b> when you're ready to
    proceed to the next task.</p>
